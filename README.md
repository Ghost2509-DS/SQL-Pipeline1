# SQL-Pipeline

This is a README file where I have created 3 layers:

1. **Bronze**  
2. **Silver**  
3. **Gold**

**Bronze Layer**  
I've done nothing here. It contains raw data.

**Silver Layer**  
I've performed data transformation. The data is no longer messy.

**Gold Layer**  
I've created a VIEW based on the Silver layer to prevent any unwanted changes to the actual data.
