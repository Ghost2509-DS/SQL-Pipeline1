This is a readme file where I have created 3 layers name
1. Bronze
2. Silver
3. Gold
In Bronze Layer I've done nothing. It has raw data.
In Silver Layer I've done transformation and the data is not messy any more.
In Gold Layer I've made a VIEW where it has data from silver layer just to not make any unwanted changes in real data.
